# Lab

In this lab, we will be creating our own fake news bot on Spark.

Be sure you are familiar with the [architecture](architecture.md) of the environment that all of this is taking place in.

## Requirements
First make sure you have everything necessary to continue:

 * Laptop
 * A [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account
 * A [Spark developer](https://developer.ciscospark.com) account

--

 
## Register Spark Bot

First head over to [http://www.developer.ciscospark.com](http://www.developer.ciscospark.com) and sign in. Sign-up if you don't already have access!

Click **My Apps** in the top right.

Click the **+** in the right to create a new bot and select the option to **create a bot**.

You can now choose your **display name** as well as **bot username**. <br>
Note: the bot username is how you will actually invite your bot to join a Spark room. It will be **botname@sparkbot.io**

Add an icon but be sure it is at least 512x512 pixels large. Google Image search may come in handy here. 

Click **Add Bot**

You will then see an Access Token. This is very important as you can only copy this once. **COPY YOUR ACCESS TOKEN**  If you don't do this, you may have to regenerate it later. Put this somewhere you can copy it again later.

## Sign up for CiscoPipeline

 * Head on over to [http://www.ciscopipeline.io](http://www.ciscopipeline.io)<p>
 * Click Sign in to begin <img src="images/githubSignin.png">
 * Login with your GitHub credentials


## Create your fake news bot!
 * Login at [http://www.ciscopipeline.io](http://www.ciscopipeline.io)
 * Click **New SparkBot** at the top right
  * Provide a **unique bot name**
  * Paste in your token from CiscoSpark
  * Provide a description for your bot
  
Your bot can consist of static text actions or be based on Python. We will be using Python for this exercise.

 * Click the **Code** tab
 * You will see a **Code Library** to the right. 
 * Click **Append to Code** next to the Cisco Umbrella; Fake News Detector
 <img src="images/appendToCode.png">
 * This will add the majority of the base code for our fake news bot:

 * Take careful note of the token in the top of the code. You will need to replace this with an Umbrella Investigate API token provided to you.
 * Then click submit at the bottom right. <img src="images/submit.png">
 * You will be taken back to a list of your Pipeline bots. Refresh the page and you should see your new bot <img src="images/running.png">

 ## Test your bot
