# Lab

In this lab, we will be creating our own fake news bot on Spark.

Be sure you are familiar with the [architecture](architecture.md) of the environment that all of this is taking place in.

## Requirements
First make sure you have everything necessary to continue:

 * Laptop
 * A [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account
 * A [Spark developer](https://developer.ciscospark.com) account

--

 
### Register Spark Bot

First head over to the [Spark Developer](http://www.developer.ciscospark.com) page and sign in. Sign-up if you don't already have access!

Click **My Apps** in the top right.

Click the **+** in the right to create a new bot and select the option to **create a bot**.

You can now choose your **display name** as well as **bot username**. <br>
Note: the bot username is how you will actually invite your bot to join a Spark room. It will be **botname@sparkbot.io**

Add an icon but be sure it is at least 512x512 pixels large. Google Image search may come in handy here. 

Click **Add Bot**

You will then see an Access Token. This is very important as you can only copy this once. **COPY YOUR ACCESS TOKEN**  If you don't do this, you may have to regenerate it later. Put this somewhere you can copy it again later.
